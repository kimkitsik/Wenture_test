Wenture technical interview task solutions. The src folder contains packages with solutions named after each task. Main class of each package is for testing and running the code.

The REST API task is in REST API folder. I couldn't get the code to work because I got various Spring Boot errors and Google wasn't much of a help. There's probably something wrong with the versions. The code itself should work.
